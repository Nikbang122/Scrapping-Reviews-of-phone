But belive me when you have it in your hand, you will regret it why don't you buy it earlier. It is that good. Yes it does not have mega battery but it compensate it with its performance. For example, You will have a micro second screen unlock with face unlock, yes it is that fast. You will love it when you get it. It is a must go phone.

5,Classy product,I moved from iPhone 8 . I is very easy to switch in between iOS devices. But the most surprising thing if this phone is its form factor. Apple is known for making phone which can be used by one hand. And still the company has retained the legacy. Everything is top notch but the Notch actually is annoying üòÇ.
